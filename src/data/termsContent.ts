You will indemnify and hold harmless Codeword Technologies Inc, and its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Services or Content or (ii) your violation of these Terms.

Dispute Resolution
Governing Law
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

Agreement to Arbitrate
You and Codeword Technologies, Inc. agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services, Products or Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "IP Protection Action"). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Codeword Technologies, Inc. with written notice of your desire to do so by email at info@ourcodeword.com within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice"). If you don't provide Codeword Technologies, Inc. with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Codeword Technologies, Inc. with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Codeword Technologies, Inc. with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Codeword Technologies, Inc. are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Codeword Technologies, Inc. otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.

Arbitration Rules
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.
